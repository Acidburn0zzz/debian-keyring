debian-keyring (2010.12.xx) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debian no longer uses PGP v3 keys as part of its infrastructure. The
    debian-keyring.pgp file is now empty and will be removed from this
    package after the Squeeze release. You should remove any mention of this
    keyring from your configs to prevent disruption when this is done.

  * A new keyring, debian-nonupload.gpg, is available. This contains the
    keys of non-uploading Debian project members.
