  [ Anthony Towns ]
  * Change byhand filename to include version and arch string for automatic
    byhand processing.
  * Add Dm-Upload-Allowed: yes header to allow for access control of
    automatic byhand processing.
  * Switch my Uploaders: address to ajt@debian.org so it passed the
    automatic byhand access control...
  * Set GNUPGHOME in runtests.

debian-maintainers (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Anthony Towns ]
  * Move debian-maintainers.gpg into /usr/share/keyrings instead of subdir.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * jeyring 0.8 avoids unnecessarily touching ~/.gnupg, so use it and remove
    the gpg --list-keys hack.
