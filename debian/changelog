debian-maintainers (0.08) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Add James Troup, Michael Beattie, Ryan Murray, Joerg Jaspert, Brian
    Nelson, Marc Brockschmidt, and Christoph Berg to the admins keyring.
    Per the GR, they all have commit access already, so it seems they might
    as well be able to easily jetring-accept changes too.
  * Add Anibal Monsalve Salazar to the admins keyring. Anibal is the newest
    member of the DM team.
  * Use pgp-clean from signing-party to strip signatures from the admins
    keyring, saving a couple megabytes from the source package.
  * Update docs, manual announcements are no longer needed since aj automated
    them at package accept time.

  [ Anibal Monsalve Salazar ]
  * Added added myself to the uploaders list.
  * Added Homepage line in debian/control.
  * Added Debian maintainer Jose Parrella.

debian-maintainers (0.06) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Explicitly build-depend on gnupg rather than rely on jetring pulling it in,
    since runtests uses it directly.
  * Documentation/process updates.
  * Add links to new advocacy mails posted for DMs for whom we previously
    used the nm.debian.org advocacy status.

  [ Anthony Towns ]
  * Add more advocacy mails and add the corresponding Debian uid of the
    advocates.
  * Sigh, actually update the index file and sig too.

debian-maintainers (0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Anthony Towns ]
  * Change byhand filename to include version and arch string for automatic
    byhand processing.
  * Add Dm-Upload-Allowed: yes header to allow for access control of
    automatic byhand processing.
  * Switch my Uploaders: address to ajt@debian.org so it passed the
    automatic byhand access control...
  * Set GNUPGHOME in runtests.

debian-maintainers (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Anthony Towns ]
  * Move debian-maintainers.gpg into /usr/share/keyrings instead of subdir.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * jeyring 0.8 avoids unnecessarily touching ~/.gnupg, so use it and remove
    the gpg --list-keys hack.

debian-maintainers (0.01) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Initial release.
  * Added Debian maintainer Miriam Ruiz

  [ Anthony Towns ]
  * Added Debian maintainer Fathi Boudra
  * Added Debian maintainer Cameron Dale
  * Invoke "gpg --list-keys" in debian/rules build to make sure
    $HOME/.gnupg exists. Possibly should set GNUPGHOME instead.
