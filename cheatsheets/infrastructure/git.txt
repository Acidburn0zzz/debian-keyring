Git working tree
----------------

Keyring work is coordinated in the Git tree living in
/org/keyring.debian.org/master-keyring.git/ at keyring.debian.org
(which is an alias to kaufmann.debian.org). You need to have an
account on kaufmann to get access to the working tree. The URL for the
Git repository is:

ssh://kaufmann.debian.org/org/keyring.debian.org/master-keyring.git/

Note that, before March 2014, we used to work on a Bazaar tree. When
the tree was imported over to Git, the only bit of lost information
were the commit signatures. The Bazaar tree up to that point (left at
commit #1297) is still available in Kaufmann, at
/org/keyring.debian.org/master-keyring/ (probably we should replace it
to avoid confusions!).


** Note: The following must be updated as well to use a public Git tree!
> 
> There is a public copy of the tree we push to whenever we push the
> updates; it is available at Debian's bzr server:
> 
> bzr+ssh://bzr.debian.org/bzr/keyring/debian-keyring
> 
> So, when you push a new revision, do:
> 
> $ bzr push --create-prefix bzr+ssh://bzr.debian.org/bzr/keyring/debian-keyring

All commits should be GPG-signed. To do so, specify your signing key
to Git, like:

$ git config user.signingkey 0x0000DEAD0000BEEF

And remember to always specify the '-S' switch when committing!

** Note: A nice Git hook can be of use here to remind us if we're
   missing -S
