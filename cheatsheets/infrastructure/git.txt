Git working tree
----------------

Keyring work is coordinated in the Git tree living in
/org/keyring.debian.org/master-keyring.git/ at keyring.debian.org
(which is an alias to kaufmann.debian.org). You need to have an
account on kaufmann to get access to the working tree. The URL for the
Git repository is:

  ssh://kaufmann.debian.org/org/keyring.debian.org/master-keyring.git/

Note that, before March 2014, we used to work on a Bazaar tree. When
the tree was imported over to Git, the only bit of lost information
were the commit signatures. The Bazaar tree up to that point (left at
commit #1297) is still available in Kaufmann, at
/org/keyring.debian.org/master-keyring/ (probably we should replace it
to avoid confusions!).

Public tree copy
----------------

There is a public copy of the tree we push to whenever we push the
updates; it is available at Debian's Git server:

  https://alioth.debian.org/anonscm/git/keyring/keyring.git

This tree can also be browsed online at:

  http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=keyring/keyring.git

So, when you push a new revision, do:

$ git push ssh://git.debian.org/git/keyring/keyring.git master

Signing commits
---------------

All commits should be GPG-signed. To do so, specify your signing key
to Git, like:

  $ git config user.signingkey 0x0000DEAD0000BEEF

And remember to always specify the '-S' switch when committing!

Note that if you use debcommit, you can ask it to always sign commits
by either setting its DEBCOMMIT_SIGN_COMMITS configuration variable or
by specifying --sign-commit in the command line.

** Note: A nice Git hook can be of use here to remind us if we're
   missing -S
