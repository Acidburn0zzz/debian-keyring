Updating a DD key
=================

- Key updates should be for a reason (i.e. lost control of earlier
  key, or moving to stronger key).

- Request must include:
  - Old key (full fingerprint)
  - New key (full fingerprint)
  - Inline signature with OLD key

- New key must be signed by at least two DDs (and more if possible);
  if the old key is particularly well connected, we have requested the
  person to get more signatures in order to avoid weakening the
  overall web of trust

- Procedure
