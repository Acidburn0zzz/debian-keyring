* lint check command:
  > Having some special command we can use to lint check the d-m
  > keyring would be a good thing. We could make it check for things like:
  > * Any entry in the keyring that has the same name/email as one in
  >   keyring.debian.org.
  > * Any entry in the new keyring that has a changed name compared to the
  >   old keyring. (A warning.)
  > * Any uid that appears on a blacklist.
  > This could run during the keyring build process and fail it if an error
  > were detected.
