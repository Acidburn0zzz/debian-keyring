What to do when reviewing a changeset to add a new DM:

* First, automatically check the key. 
  This adds a KeyCheck field to the changeset.

  ./keycheck changeset

* Review the changeset:

  - Does the KeyCheck look ok?
  - Is the key signed by more than one DD? At least one DD?
    More than 1 is preferred.
  - Is there at least one advocate?
  - Does the applicant acknowledge Debian's social contract, free software
    guidelines, and machine usage policies?

* Double-check the changes the changeset will make to the keyring:

  make
  jetring-review -d debian-maintainers.gpg changeset

  Make sure nothing fishy is going on..

* If the changeset and applicant look ok to add:

  1. Fill in the Changed-By field with your name and email address.
  2. jetring-accept debian-maintainers changeset
  3. Update the changelog.
