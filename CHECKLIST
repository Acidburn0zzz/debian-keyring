What to do when reviewing a changeset to add a new DM:

* First, automatically check the key. 
  This adds a KeyCheck field to the changeset, and runs the test suite on
  it.

  ./keycheck changeset
  ./testchangeset changeset

* Review the changeset:

  - Does the KeyCheck look ok?
  - Is the key signed by more than one DD? At least one DD?
    More than 1 is preferred.
  - Is there at least one advocate?
  - Does the applicant acknowledge Debian's social contract, free software
    guidelines, and machine usage policies? If they have a page
    on nm.debian.org, they agreed to these already. So normally, just
    checking if the NM-Page exists and is valid should be sufficient.

* Double-check the changes the changeset will make to the keyring:

  make
  jetring-review -d debian-maintainers.gpg changeset

  Make sure nothing fishy is going on..

* If the changeset and applicant look ok to add:

  1. Fill in the Changed-By field with your name and email address.
  2. jetring-accept debian-maintainers changeset
  3. dch "Added Debian maintainer Their Name"
  4. svn add debian-maintainers/*
  5. debcommit
  6. Upload the new version of the package so it will go live and the new 
     DMs can upload their packages.
