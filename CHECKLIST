What to do when reviewing a changeset:

* Check the changeset. This runs the test suite on it to sanity check it,
  and if it tests ok, displays a diff of exactly what changes
  the changeset will introduce.
  
  ./review changeset

  Make sure nothing fishy is going on..

* If the changeset is adding a new DM, you'll want to use keycheck to
  generate a report. The report is put in the KeyCheck field of the changset.

  ./keycheck changeset

* Review the changeset:

  - Does the KeyCheck look ok?
  - Is the key signed by more than one DD? At least one DD?
    More than 1 is preferred.
  - Is there at least one advocate?
  - Does the applicant acknowledge Debian's social contract, free software
    guidelines, and machine usage policies?
  - Does the applicant already maintain at least one package in the
    archive? (Listed as the Maintainer or in Uploaders) Does the package
    source have XS-DM-Upload-Allowed: yes set? If not, the applicant isn't
    ready to upload, and should be told what needs to be done.

* If the changeset and applicant look ok to add:

  0. Mention this to debian-projects@lists.debian.org
  1. Fill in the Changed-By field with your name and email address.
  2. jetring-accept debian-maintainers changeset
  3. dch "Added Debian maintainer Their Name"
  4. git add .
  5. debcommit
  6. Tag your new version with a signed tag. With devscripts >= 2.10.10,
     set DEBCOMMIT_SIGN_TAGS=yes in ~/.devscripts and then you can just use
     debcommit -r to create a signed tag.
  7. git push origin master && git push --tags
  8. Upload the new version of the package so it will go live and the new 
     DMs can upload their packages.
